# Stupid Hackathon 5 webpage

[Live Website](https://sht-5.vercel.app)

## Notice

Since the event's now over, we've hardcoded everything and removed all firebase stuff out of the website. Despite this, we've still kept everything in the main branch and do the hardcoded stuff in a different branch (`/hardcode`) instead.

## Technology

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (didn't use it, it's just there for fun :0)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Nes.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) (didn't include it in prod but we based off our buttons from it)
* [Typescript :3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [rscss](https://rscss.io/) (found it useful and wanted to share it)
