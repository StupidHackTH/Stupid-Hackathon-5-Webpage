## Notice

Since the event's now over, we've hardcoded everything and removed all firebase stuff out of the website. Despite of this, we've still kept everything in the main branch and do the hardcoded stuff in a different branch (`/hardcode`) instead.

## Technology

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (didn't use it, it's just there for fun :0)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Nes.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) (didn't include it in prod but we based our buttons out of it)
* [Typescript :3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [rscss](https://rscss.io/) (found it useful and wanted to share it)
